2. Check if the units weapons are already added. If they are not then add them in.
(remember that units, especially characters, can sometimes have different versions of the same weapon. Especially with attack number)

3. Check if the unit's keyword is already added. Add if it's missing.

4. Check if the possible models included in the unit are already added. Add any missing ones.
